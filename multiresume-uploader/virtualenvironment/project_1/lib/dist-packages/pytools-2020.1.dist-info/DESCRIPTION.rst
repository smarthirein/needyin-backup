Pytools is a big bag of things that are "missing" from the Python standard
library. This is mainly a dependency of my other software packages, and is
probably of little interest to you unless you use those. If you're curious
nonetheless, here's what's on offer:

* A ton of small tool functions such as `len_iterable`, `argmin`,
  tuple generation, permutation generation, ASCII table pretty printing,
  GvR's mokeypatch_xxx() hack, the elusive `flatten`, and much more.
* Michele Simionato's decorator module
* A time-series logging module, `pytools.log`.
* Batch job submission, `pytools.batchjob`.
* A lexer, `pytools.lex`.
