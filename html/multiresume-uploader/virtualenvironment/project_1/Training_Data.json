NLB is particularly useful for ensuring that stateless applications, such as a Web server running Internet Information Services (IIS), are scalable by adding additional servers as the load increases. \n· Enabling Kerberos Authentication Mechanism For SharePoint environment: \nKerberos is a secure protocol that grants authentication tickets if the client’s request to the Key Distribution Centre (KDC) contains valid user credentials and a valid Service Principal Name (SPN). Kerberos is the preferred authentication type for SharePoint because it is faster, more secure, and reduces the number of errors you can get with username and passwords than NTLM.

NLB is particularly useful for ensuring that stateless applications, such as a Web server running Internet Information Services (IIS), are scalable by adding additional servers as the load increases. \n· Enabling Kerberos Authentication Mechanism For SharePoint environment: \nKerberos is a secure protocol that grants authentication tickets if the client’s request to the Key Distribution Centre (KDC) contains valid user credentials and a valid Service Principal Name (SPN). Kerberos is the preferred authentication type for SharePoint because it is faster, more secure, and reduces the number of errors you can get with username and passwords than NTLM. If the SharePoint website uses external data (located on different servers than the SharePoint server itself) ex. to SQL databases through web parts the SharePoint server needs Kerberos to delegate the client credentials (the credentials are never sent over the wire, only tickets which the KDC keeps track of).

I am attaching apk .\nACADEMIC PROJECT\nMain Project:\nTitle                : “Remote GSM Mobile Phone Controlled Robotic Arm with Base Rotation, Elbow and Wrist Motion with a Functional Gripper”\n· Platform: embedded systems.\nDescription   :This project is designed with base rotation, elbow and wrist motion with a functional gripper to hold objects. The uniqueness of this project is, this can be controlled by a mobile phone from a remote place by using the DTMF decoder and mobile head set. \n                  Now when we dial the numbers in the mobile phone from the controlling side then it automatically recognizes which number has been recorded and it follows with the corresponding next step to be taken i.e., movement of the robot. Depending on the call the DTMF decoder decodes the signal of moment in the robotic arm, Base rotation, Elbow, wrist motion along with functional gripper. The total process is controlled by the controller and its associated circuitry which makes driver circuit to drive the motor/s for movement of the robotic arm.\nMini Project    :  \n· Title: “Vigilance Control Device”      \n· Platform:  embedded systems\nDescription:   The vigilance control device is a kind of ring which would be given to loco pilots on duty. This biometric device would help to stay alert and generate warnings if they fall asleep on duty. Loco pilots are given walkie-talkie set to get in touch with station master and cabin man in case of any doubt about signal failures or any other fault in the operating system, it has come to light that most of these pilots hardly use it which often results in derailments or mishaps on tracks due to human error. This device would at least check such mishaps by keeping the pilot’s alert while on duty.\nSTRENGTHS\n· Ease at learning new things.\n· Ability to work under time and accuracy pressures.\n· Hard worker &self-confidence.\nPERSONAL PROFILE\n\nName\t\t\t\t:   D.Sumanth\nFather’s Name  \t\t :Kalyanvaraprasad\nDate of Birth\t\t\t :  02-10-1900\nGender   \t\t\t  :   Male\nMarital status \t\t\t  :  Single\nNationality    \t\t\t  :   Indian\nHobbies\t\t\t  :   Making Friends, Watching T.V., Listening Music.\nLanguages Known\t\t  :   English, and Telugu.\nPermanent Address                     :H.NO#20-27- 4,Rice colony\n                                                           Chinnaravuru, Tenali.\n                                                          Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDECLARATION\n                 “I hereby declare that the above furnished details are true to best of my knowledge and belief.”\n\nPlace:\nDate      :                                                                                                               (D.Sumanth)","annotation":[{"label":["NAME"],"points":[{"start":4198,"end":4206,"text":"D.Sumanth"}]},{"label":["LOCATION"],"points":[{"start":3907,"end":3912,"text":"Guntur"}]},{"label":["NAME"],"points":[{"start":3434,"end":3442,"text":"D.Sumanth"}]},{"label":["Project Name"],"points":[{"start":2607,"end":2630,"text":"Vigilance Control Device"}]},{"label":["Project Name"],"points":[{"start":1600,"end":1714,"text":"Remote GSM Mobile Phone Controlled Robotic Arm with Base Rotation, Elbow and Wrist Motion with a Functional Gripper"}]},{"label":["Programming_Language"],"points":[{"start":1391,"end":1398,"text":"CoreJava"}]},{"label":["ENVIRONMENT"],"points":[{"start":1341,"end":1354,"text":"Android Studio"}]},{"label":["Project Name"],"points":[{"start":1307,"end":1321,"text":"Diagnostic Test"}]},{"label":["Programming_Language"],"points":[{"start":1128,"end":1135,"text":"CoreJava"}]},{"label":["ENVIRONMENT"],"points":[{"start":1078,"end":1091,"text":"Android Studio"}]},{"label":["PROJECT & CLIENT","Project Name"],"points":[{"start":1045,"end":1058,"text":"Airportfalcons"}]},{"label":["DATABASE"],"points":[{"start":979,"end":1003,"text":"SQL Server,SQLite browser"}]},{"label":["EDUCATION"],"points":[{"start":522,"end":821,"text":"M-Tech\n\t\nA.M.Reddy College of Engineering \n\t\nJNTUK\n\t\n2016\n\t\n71.00%\n\n\t\nB-Tech\n\tTenali Engineering College\n\t\nJNTUK\n\t\n2013\n\t\n68.88 %\n\n\t\nIntermediate\n\t\nSri ChaitanyaJunior College\n\t\nBoard of Intermediate\n\t\n2008\n\t\n65.00 %\n\n\t\nSSC\n\t\nLittle Citizens School\n\t\nBoard of secondary education.

Support responsibility starts from booking a trade to the final report generation. This is established through the ITRS and Autosys. Few applications are(SFS,SFR,EDGE,FUSION,ALPS,IPB,GP,FE,FIPB,CA,CFR,PFR,AH,REF DATA,WIRES etc.)\nCITI Prime Finance Swaps\nThe purpose of swap product is to offer clients all the benefits of holding trading portfolio without them having to purchase or own any actual stock. Trades are input into upstream system -Colt and then fed (via IPB – International Prime Brokerage) to PFS. These trades are then converted into swap trades. Swap details are then fed, in the batch, to the Swap database where the Actuate reports are generated from. The Actuate reports are configured to take data from the IPB Repository and not the consolidated database thus updates can be made to the data during intraday and there ports regenerated - there is currently no functionality to produce reports for prior business dates however, this is currently being developed. Swap trades are also fed to downstream database – Prime Broker DB for inclusion in the feed to system –Sea mans to allow for margining.\nCITI Prime Finance (CPM & MERIT)\nCross Product Margin (CPM) & Multi Entity Risk Integration Tool (MERIT) used for determining the VAR (Value at Risk) in Trading level as well as portfolio level on daily basis. This VAR calculation targets the Hedge Funds. MERIT & CPM receives feeds from different system like foreign currency (FX), mortgage details, and daily trade details. These feeds are given as input to Risk Calculation Engine which is in CPM. It will give VAR reports on Trade level and portfolio level. This reports used for calculating the margins.\nCiti Agency/Security lendingi\n Securities lending refers to the lending of securities by one party to another. The terms of the loan will be governed by a \", Securities Lending Agreement& quot, which requires that the borrower provides the lender with collateral, in the form of cash or non-cash securities, of value equal to or greater than the loaned securities plus agreed upon margin. Non-cash refers to the subset of collateral that is not pure cash, including equities, government bonds, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, and other products. The agreement is a contract enforceable under relevant Citi law, which is often specified in the agreement. As payment for the loan, the parties negotiate a fee, quoted as an annualized percentage of the value of the loaned securities. If the agreed form of collateral is cash, then the fee may be quoted as a \", short rebate& quot , meaning that the lender will earn all of the interest which accrues on the cash collateral, and will \", rebate& quot, an agreed rate of interest to the borrower. Key lenders of securities include mutual funds, insurance companies, pension plans and other large investment portfolios Securities Lending is legal and clearly regulated in most of the world's major securities markets. Most markets mandate that the borrowing of securities be conducted only for specifically permitted purposes, which generally include;\n· To facilitate settlement of a trade,\n· To facilitate delivery of a short sale,\n· To finance the security, or\n· To facilitate a loan to another borrower who is motivated by one of these permitted purposes.\nWhen a security is loaned, the title of the security transfers to the borrower. This means that the borrower has the advantages of holding the security, as they become the full legal and beneficial owner of it. Specifically, the borrower will receive all coupon and/or dividend payments, and any other rights such as voting rights. In most cases, these dividends or coupons must be passed back to the lender in the form of what is referred to as a& quot, manufactured dividend & quot.  The initial driver for the securities lending business was to cover settlement failure. If one party fails to deliver stock to you it can mean that you are unable to deliver stock that you have already sold to another party. In order to avoid the costs and penalties that can arise from settlement failure, stock could be borrowed at a fee, and delivered to the second party. When your initial stock finally arrived (or was obtained from another source) lender would receive back the same number of shares in the security they lent. The principal reason for borrowing a security is to cover a short position. As you are obliged to deliver the security, you will have to borrow it. At the end of the agreement you will have to return an equivalent security to the lender. Equivalent in this context means fungible, i.e. the securities have to be completely interchangeable.\nDURATION OF THE PROJECT\n· AUG 2014 –  Till date\nRoles and Responsibility in the project \n· My

GTX (Global Technology Exchange) concept which is the bottom-line product that handles most of the deutsche bank’s SWIFT FIN traffic. GTX supports multiple networks like SWIFT, SIC, Telex, Fax, Email. It provides a single window access to all of the SWIFT services (FIN, RMA, File ACT, InterACT). GTX can be called as backbone of FMS application, which connects all the backend channels through multi-connectors and delivers web services to external applications in the context of service oriented architecture (SOA).\nSWIFT- Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is a network established to have common standards for financial transactions and a shared data processing system.\n\nThe main components of FMS application are:\nCBT - Computer Based Terminal, message validation takes place and gets distributed to different nodes.\nNPI - Network processing Integration, inbound/outbound messages are processed.\n\nGT Bridge - is a layer through which the messages are flown from CBT/NPI as well as to the backend channels. This layer is responsible for delivery/failure of messages.\nOMS - Output Management System, a DB developed product which handles all printing/emails.\n\nMessage types:\n\nMT940 - regular basis statement.\n\nMT942 - interim statement sent to the customer on their request.\nMT950 – statements sent directly to the customer.\n\nComing to the application architecture, FMS uses the Resilience concept (Cross configuration), 2 decoupled active instances that replicate their data to the other side. This concept justifies that a failure of one instance does not harm continuous processing of the remaining instance.\nROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES: -   \n\n· Involved in Second Level Production Support handling various critical issues & participate during outages for resolution of issues.\n\n· Analyzing logs and fixing the issues and supporting business user’s queries.\n\n· Ensure proper escalation matrix is followed based on the applications.\n\n· Ensure all tickets that are raised adhere to the defined SLA.\n\n· Ensure Quality Incident tickets are raised & resolved.\n\n· Interacting with Clients for requirement gathering and clarifications when new applications are on boarded.\n\n· Involved in change request processing, solving production issues.\n\n· Involved in Documentation & creating KEDB, report generation.\n\n· Responsible for analyzing the monthly tickets data and ensuring automation of manual activities.\n\n· Performing Proactive checks to ensure stability of the applications.\n\n· Application/Batch Monitoring and Health Check activities (SOW/EOW).\n· Responsible for resolving Day to Day and critical Production issues within the stipulate SLA.\n\n· Coordinating with upstream and downstream teams for weekend release and maintenance activities.\n\n· Updating KEDB and raising KCS articles for the team to follow.\n· Having good knowledge on .net deployment.\nPERSONAL DETAILS\n\n· Name\n               \n:\nPRAMODH KUMAR M\n\n· Father's name\n\n:\nMUNIYAPPA D\n\n· Date of birth\n\n:\n03-08-1989\n\n· Nationality       \n \n:\nINDIAN\n\n· Marital status\n\n:\nSINGLE\n\n· Permanent Address       \n: \n#351, 6TH Cross, Ambedkar Nagar,\n\nWhitefield Post, Blore-560066\n\n· Hobbies\n\n:      \nSurfing latest technologies & Current affairs on Internet,      \nListening songs\n\nDECLARATION\n\nI hereby declare that the information furnished above is true to best of my knowledge.\n\nDate:\nPlace: Bangalore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PRAMODH KUMAR .M)\n\n\n\nPage 5","annotation":[{"label":["Name","NAME"],"points":[{"start":14474,"end":14489,"text":"PRAMODH KUMAR .M"}]},{"label":["LOCATION"],"points":[{"start":14455,"end":14463,"text":"Bangalore"}]},{"label":["Pin"],"points":[{"start":14232,"end":14237,"text":"560066"}]},{"label":["LOCATION"],"points":[{"start":14226,"end":14230,"text":"Blore"}]},{"label":["NAME"],"points":[{"start":14004,"end":14018,"text":"PRAMODH KUMAR M"}]},{"label":["Roles & Responsibilities","Responsibilities"],"points":[{"start":12757,"end":13959,"text":"· Involved in Second Level Production Support handling various critical issues & participate during outages for resolution of issues.\n\n· Analyzing logs and fixing the issues and supporting business user’s queries.\n\n· Ensure proper escalation matrix is followed based on the applications.\n\n· Ensure all tickets that are raised adhere to the defined SLA.\n\n· Ensure Quality Incident tickets are raised & resolved.\n\n· Interacting with Clients for requirement gathering and clarifications when new applications are on boarded.\n\n· Involved in change request processing, solving production issues.\n\n· Involved in Documentation & creating KEDB, report generation.\n\n· Responsible for analyzing the monthly tickets data and ensuring automation of manual activities.\n\n· Performing Proactive checks to ensure stability of the applications.\n\n· Application/Batch Monitoring and Health Check activities (SOW/EOW).\n· Responsible for resolving Day to Day and critical Production issues within the stipulate SLA.\n\n· Coordinating with upstream and downstream teams for weekend release and maintenance activities.\n\n· Updating KEDB and raising KCS articles for the team to follow.\n· Having good knowledge on .net deployment."}]},{"label":["PROJECT DESCRIPTION"],"points":[{"start":10937,"end":11381,"text":"Financial Messaging System is software application within DB, responsible for the successful implementation of the new financial messaging solution.

To collaborate with each other, each of the GUI components in the application need to communicate with each other. The main objective of Bhalu is to help even junior java application developers for developing complex data driven GUI applications. Bhalu requires just few lines to instantiate and initialize each of the java object for presenting a GUI component. Bhalu requires about 2 to 3 lines of code for creating communication code between any two GUI components in the application.\n\n\tOwn Project Details\n\n\n\n\t\nProject Tittle\n\t\nTECHSTUDYHUB (www.techstudyhub.com)\n\n\t\nTechnologies used\n\t\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, JSP, MySQL, Amazon Hosting. \n\n\t        \nOperating system\n\t\nWindows\n\n\t\nLearning\n\t\nReal time project managerial skills.\n\n\t\n\n\n\nDescription\n\t\nTechStudyHub is a Technical Study Hub for all learners.

The GSPs exchange manifests required for customs clearance with the FedEx server. GRASPWin application allows GSP personnel to receive inbound manifests from FedEx and to send outbound manifests and POD/DEX scans to FedEx. The software also helps keep track of items in the cage and produce various reports.\n· FedEx has engaged Wipro to re-engineer GRASP Win v3.1.7 (termed as the base line version of GRASP) in Microsoft .NET 2.0 environment using C# as the language of choice. \n· Certain functionalities of the base line GRASP are no longer required. At the same time, there is a need to include new functionalities into the software to meet the business requirements.\n· The base line GRASP, developed in older versions Uniface and Sybase SQL Anywhere environment, has evolved over several years, posing maintenance and enhancement challenges. At the same time, there is a need to bring GRASP on the same platform as other projects at FedEx EMEA.\n· Wipro proposes to re-engineer the base line GRASP in Microsoft .NET 2.0 environment using C#. The new, .NET version of GRASP will be termed as GRASP.NET v1. \n\n\n\tResponsibilities\n\t· To Meet better project norm followed all the wipro policies & standards in completing the given work. Helped out in achieving all the wipro norms by doing successful testing process. Reproduced the QC issues and tested them properly.\n· Involved in Testing the GRASP application. GRASP is a Reengineering project and a Windows based .Net application. In this project, we have 7 modules and I worked for 5 modules. I was involved in writing System test cases for 5 modules and also executed the same. I was involved in writing Integration test cases and also executed the same. I was involved in writing 50% of Installation and Migration test cases. I worked for writing CR test cases and executed the same. I was involved in Adhoc testing. I was involved in testing different builds. The Builds that I tested were 22. \n· I was involved in Exhaustive Testing of the application and prevented in increasing the count of the issues. Worked for Installation and Migration related issues.\n· Given Max error free work.\n\n· In the process of testing the GRASP application, Tested 5 modules (5/7). I found 70% of the bugs in all the 5 modules. The error rate was 50/module and 2 errors/ page. As I have been involved in 5 modules each module came up with several data base issues in which some were so critical.I found many DB related issues and Unhandled Exceptions.

BIP’s design philosophy is to make the data reusable across different project implementations and available to different banking users. Using different tools to connect to BIP, different teams are enabled to support MIS, Analytics, and even regulatory reporting requirements. \n\nThe overview of data flow and data transformation from source applications to the different BIP layers then to the downstream marts and views\n\nProcess begins where data are extracted from source files and processed in Informatica to handle data type exceptions and to complete other file validations. Data is then loaded to OIA (Operational Image Area) after source key validation for full files or for maintenance of snapshots where incremental data from source is received or for maintaining history, if applicable. Data exceptions are loaded to separate tables for tracking/resolution.\n\nData from OIA are transformed based on the source-to-target mapping specifications and BMAP/reference table validations to fit into the BIP Common Data Model (CDM) / SIM (Simplified Integrated Model) and to consolidate/apply changes to the CDM/SIM history tables. \n\nData from CDM/SIM are extracted and transformed for downstream usage. Transient tables may be utilized to simplify complex transformations. Transformation of target reference values to the business values are also performed in this layer. \n\nTransformed data from CDM/SIM layer are loaded to downstream target tables for commonly-used information and user-driven requirements.. \n\nTransformed and untransformed views are made available to downstream users for reporting, analysis, and data mining via different reporting tools such as SAS, Qlikview, BO, etc. \n\n\t \n\tProject Contribution:- Data Modelling for 200 + URs ( User Requests)\n- Data Modelling for Regionalization Project ( GDW HK to BIP - SG Migration)\n- Data Modelling for CDM / SIM, ADM, XTR, CRA DB.\n- Review of Data Mapping Sheets (Prepared by Data Analyst)\n- Management of BMAP Sheets for Reference Data.\n- Tools used: ER win 13.x / Model Mart\n- Database : Teradata / Hive (Hadoop)\n- Industry: Banking\n \n\n\t11/2014 - 05/2015\n\t(Royal Bank of Scotland(RBS))\n\n\t7 month(s)\n\tRBS -SVoC Enterprise Data warehouse Programme\n\n\t \n\tProject Description:In 2011 RBS began a programme of work to implement a cross functional Strategic Data Warehouse in the UK, using Informatica as the ETL tool, Teradata as the underlying technology platform for the database, SAS as the analytics toolset and an industry standard data model tailored for use in RBS to structure the data (RBS-LDM).\n\nThe intent of the Retail Data Warehouse programme is to provide an EDW which has data elements from Core and Non Core systems.
